# skeleton-keys
An open source repository to help create skeleton files in a variety of languages and usable for many frameworks. 

This repo will start with a variety of bash scripts, with the idea that each language that follows will use the format
and methodologies that are appropriate for that specific language.

Hierarchy will be as follows:

- Language
- - Skeleton
- - Tests
- - Library

This is meant to be public. Anyone can view it, review it, offer suggestions, do anything they want with it :).
